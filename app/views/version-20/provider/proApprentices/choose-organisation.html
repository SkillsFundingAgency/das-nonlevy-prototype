      What is a contract for services?

  <div class="govuk-details__text">
<p>A contract for services is a formal agreement between a buyer and a supplier.</p>

<p>In this case, the contract is between the organisation that's buying apprenticeship training and assessment for their apprentices and the training provider or end-point assessment organisaion that's training or assessing the apprentices.</p>

<p>If you're an employer-provider, for example, you won't need a contract for services for training as your organisation is both the buyer and the supplier, but you will need one for end-point assessment.</p>
